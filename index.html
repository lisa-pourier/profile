        I always get stuck when I need say something about myself and wonder ðŸ’­ "what do I talk about?"<br>
        I am here at a coding bootcamp, I might as well talk about that.<br>
        BUT, I am so much more than whatever is happening at this bootcamp.
        <!-- I used to work as a Business Analyst and "developed" tools in Excel.<br>
        I then discovered coding and thought that could be my next step, to improve myself.<br>
        Afterall, I did enjoy creating things, both the logical aspect as well as the creative aspect.<br>
        This was 7 yrs ago.<br>
        It feels like a long time that I've been dabbling with coding, trying to learn online.<br>
        Now I am here, at this bootcamp, I am happy to be here and excited for my new world of coding.<br> -->
